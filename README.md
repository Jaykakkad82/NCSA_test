## Problem : String_Processor
### ============= Question ====================
 - Replace all the vowels in the string “National Center for Supercomputing Applications” by their corresponding order number in alphabetical sequence (a with 1, e with 5, etc).
 - Print the resulting string.
 - Print the total number of consonants in the given string.

### ==== Logic====
- Assumption: Both upper and lowercase 'A'/ 'a' can be replaced with '1' and so on.
- use ascii values of each character. Use list to replace character in string.
- time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)
